## Solution
Because of the clue of being able to read it with eyes closed, this eventually led us to think about Braille. Converting the GIF to individual frames, we were able to translate each frame into a character. In some cases, we found that two frames were used to incidate a number. The rules for translating Braille that we used to solve the flag were found on Wikipedia (`https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braille#Derivation`). The flag is `dsc{d0-y0u-th1nk-h3-s4w-us7132}`.
